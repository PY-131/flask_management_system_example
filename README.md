## Overview

This Flask project contains a simple user management functionality to demonstrate the use of py.test.

## Motivation

After reading Brian Okken's book (Python Testing with py.test), I was convinced that I should learn about py.test and then figure out how to use it to test Flask applications.

## How to Run

In the top-level directory:

    $ export FLASK_APP=main.py
    $ flask run

## Key Python Modules Used

- Flask: micro-framework for web application development

This application is written using Python 3.6.

## Unit Testing
